## DESCRIPTION:

Virtual Pet Shiba is a cute , animated dog on your watch that you can power up with your steps. Modeled after a real Shiba, this virtual dog has all the sass and attitude of the famous Japanese Breed known as a "doge." Mako, a real Shiba puppy from California, was used as the inspiration and model for the design.

Have fun exercising as this little dog gains hearts while you reach your goals. The virtual dog has three modes: sitting, walking, and sleeping. Based on your activity levels the dog will change what it does throughout the day and will have different moods.

Every month there is a new surprise for your virtual pet!
